# ðŸ§  Embedded Linux Practice

A curated collection of Embedded Linux projects developed for learning and mastering low-level system programming, build automation, and board bring-up.
Each sub-project focuses on a specific embedded concept â€” from basic C library management to Linux kernel module, Yocto BSP, and bootloader customization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This repository is built as a learning roadmap for Embedded Linux engineers who want to:
- Understand how Linux interacts with hardware.
- Build firmware components from scratch (bootloader â†’ kernel â†’ rootfs).
- Learn to use Yocto Project for system integration.
- Practice driver development, secure boot, and debugging tools.

## ðŸ§° Development Environment

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Compiler: GCC / ARM-GCC
- Build Systems: Make, CMake, BitBake (Yocto)
- Boards: BeagleBone Black, Raspberry Pi
